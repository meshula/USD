The path </Model_1/Instance/Test> is the target of multiple relocations from different sources. The following relocates to this target are invalid and will be ignored: relocation from </Model_1/Instance/ClassChild> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_1>; relocation from </Model_1/Instance/InstanceChild> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_1>.
The path </Model_3/Instance/Test> is the target of multiple relocations from different sources. The following relocates to this target are invalid and will be ignored: relocation from </Model_3/Instance/ClassChild> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3>; relocation from </Model_3/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3>.
Relocation from </Model_2/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_2/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_2> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_2/Test> to </Model_2/Instance/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_2> and will be ignored: The target of a relocate cannot be the source of another relocate in the same layer stack.
Relocation from </Model_2/Test> to </Model_2/Instance/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_2> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_2/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_2/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_2> and will be ignored: The source of a relocate cannot be the target of another relocate in the same layer stack.
Relocation from </Model_3/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_3/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_3/Test> to </Model_3/Instance/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3> and will be ignored: The target of a relocate cannot be the source of another relocate in the same layer stack.
Relocation from </Model_3/Test> to </Model_3/Instance/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_3/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_3/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_3> and will be ignored: The source of a relocate cannot be the target of another relocate in the same layer stack.
Relocation from </Model_4/Instance/InstanceChild/InstanceGrandChild> to </Model_4/Test/Child> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_4> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_4/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_4/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_4> and will be ignored: The source of a relocate cannot be a descendant of the source of another relocate.
Relocation from </Model_5/Instance/ClassChild> to </Model_5/Instance/InstanceChild/ClassChild> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_5> conflicts with another relocation from </Model_5/Instance/InstanceChild> to </Model_5/Test> authored at @ErrorInvalidConflictingRelocates/root.sdf@</Model_5> and will be ignored: The target of a relocate cannot be a descendant of the source of another relocate.
