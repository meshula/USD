# Nanocolor

## A very small color transform library

### Pixar Animation Studios

## Introduction

Color management and transformation is a complex domain.
Values are captured by cameras or generated by renderers,
transferred to a storage medium, combined into frame buffers
to make new images, transformed for display, and projected
by devices. During each step, the color values may be
transformed by photochemical, electro-optical, and digital
processes.

A renderer's input working space to output working space is
an interesting subset of that domain, and it's the subset
that Nanocolor concerns itself with.

OpenEXR goes so far as to restrict itself to linear working
spaces, and describes them completed by specifying chromaticities
and an adapted whitepoint in the CIE XYZ 1931 space. Nanocolor
takes inspiration from this, and uses the equations in SMPTE
document RP177-1993 (reaffirmed in 2002) ~ SMPTE Recommended
Practice: Derivation of Basic Television Equations.

Interesting colors do not just come from OpenEXR however, but
may originate as properties in a MaterialX shade graph, vertex
attributes in an OpenUSD file, or PNG or TIFF textures, to
name a few common sources.

Amongst all these sources, only OpenEXR specifies colors in terms
of chromaticities and whitepoint. Some sources specify the color
space in documentation, whereas others name color spaces in the
data itself, or refer to site specific configuration files in
the OpenColorIO format, and other alternatives. This lack of
broad agreement on such things as what the name of a colorspace
actually refers to makes accurate and reproducible color
calculations between software packages and studios challenging.

MaterialX takes an interesting perspective; it names a bakers'
dozen of color spaces and defines them as OpenEXR does, and
also introduces a notion of being able to remove an input transform
from a color in order to accomodate image formats commonly used
as texture sources for shader graphs.

Nanocolor follows this idea, and also introduces that all the
color spaces must be invertible, in the sense that a value can
have its input transform removed to make it a linear color value,
linear values may be transformed as desired through matrix
multiplication, and an output transform may be re-applied. This
allows Nanocolor to transform any color space with this invertible
property to any other with the invertible property.

## Nanocolor API

For a description of data types, please refer to Nanocolor.h

```c
NcColorSpace     NcGetNamedColorSpace(const char* name);
NcM33f           NcGetRGBToXYZMatrix(NcColorSpace* cs);
NcM33f           NcGetXYZToRGBMatrix(NcColorSpace* cs);
NcColorTransform NcGetRGBToRGBTransform(NcColorSpace* src, NcColorSpace* dst);
NcRGB            NcTransformColor(NcColorSpace* dst, NcColorSpace* src, NcRGB rgb);
NcXYZ            NcRGBToXYZ(NcColorSpace* cs, NcRGB rgb);
NcRGB            NcXYZToRGB(NcColorSpace* cs, NcXYZ xyz);
void             NcInitColorSpace(NcColorSpace* cs);
NcColorSpace     NcMakeEmptyColorSpace(void);
```

`NcGetNamedColorSpace` ~ returns a named color space, if it is
known by Nanocolor

`NcGetRGBToXYZMatrix` ~ given a color space compute the
corresponding RP177-1993 3x3 matrix

`NcGetXYZToRGBMatrix` ~ given a color space compute the
corresponding RP177-1993 3x3 matrix

`NcGetRGBToRGBTransform` ~ given two color spaces, compute a
color transform that moves a color from the source color 
space to a destination

`NcTransformColor` ~ a convience function, that given a color and
two color spaces, transforms the color and returns it. Note that
if many values must be transformed it's far more efficient to reuse
a color transform object.

`NcRGBToXYZ` ~ return the XYZ coordinates for an RGB color

`NcXYZToRGB` ~ return an RGB color given XYZ coordinates

`NcInitColorSpace` ~ create an identity color space which can be
further modified to create a color space object compatible with
the other functions

`NcMakeEmptyColorSpace` ~ allocates a color space object using
malloc. deprecated.

## NanocolorUtils API

`NanocolorUtils.h` declares a number of useful functions such as
might be used by test programs and the like. It is an optional
component, and you may choose to omit it from your project.

```c
NcXYZ NcKelvinToYxy(float temperature, float luminosity);
NcRGB* NcISO17321_AP0_ColorChips();
NcXYZ NcNormalizeXYZ(NcXYZ c);
NcRGB NcYxyToRGB(NcColorSpace* cs, NcYxy c);
NcXYZ NcCIE1931ColorFromWavelength(float lambda, bool approx);
```

`NcKelvinToYxy` ~ returns an XYZ coordinate for the blackbody 
emission spectrum for values between 1667 and 25000K

`NcISO17321_AP0_ColorChips` ~ return a pointer to 24 color values
in the ap0 gamut corresponding to the 24 color chips in ISO 
standard chart 17321

`NcNormalizeXYZ(NcXYZ c)` ~ given a CIE XYZ 1931 color
coordinate, normalize it to a unit luminance

`NcYxyToRGB` ~ given a CIEXY coordinate, and a luminace,
compute an RGB value for the given color space

`NcCIE1931ColorFromWavelength` ~ compute a CIE XYZ coordinate
for a given wavelength. If plotted, the values will land on
the boundary of the familiar color gamut diagram.

## Building

The interface types are expected to never change, and to be 
compatible between all versions of Nanocolor. The functions however
may change, and may be locally modified, and it's expected that
more than one copy of Nanocolor may be linked. Therefore, they are 
namespaced via a macro, even though the names appear to be simply
prefixed with Nc. When building Nanocolor, you may provide your
own preprocessor macro to distinguish your copy of it.

```c
#ifndef NCNAMESPACE
#define NCNAMESPACE pxr_nc_1_0_
#endif
```

There are no build scripts included with Nanocolor. You may build
it as a library if you wish, or you may include Nanocolor.cpp,
and optionally NanocolorUtils.cpp in your project.
